# Monte Carlo Simulations

Monte Carlo Simulation, also known as the Monte Carlo Method or a multiple probability simulation,
is a mathematical technique, which is used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event.
This process is really important at modelizing the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot 
easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. Often used in finance and data science for the 
forecasting of behaviors.

My project relies on to simulate random variables following a bunch of well-known laws such as discrets and continuous ones in Python using Jupyther 
to visualize them.
